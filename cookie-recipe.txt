INGREDIENTS:

1. 1 cup butter, softened
2. 2/3 cup cocoa powder
3. 1 1/2 cups white sugar
4. 3/4 teaspoon baking soda
5. 2 eggs
6. 1/4 teaspoon salt
7. 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
8. 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips
9. 2 cups all-purpose flour
10. 1/2 cup chopped walnuts (optional)

DIRECTIONS:

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
2. In large bowl, beat butter, sugar, eggs, and vanilla until light and fluffy. Combine the flour, cocoa, baking soda, and salt; stir into the butter mixture until well blended. Mix in the chocolate chips and walnuts. Drop by rounded teaspoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheets.
3. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or just until set. Cool slightly on the cookie sheets before transferring to wire racks to cool completely.
